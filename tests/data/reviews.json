Di you by any chance note something? If yes, then that's great, f not well, this is the second time I'm featuring Ayumi Komura's work on my blog. The first one was her longest serialization - Liar Lily. I loved the story a lot; so don't be fooled by my rating. I was debating whether to give it 3.5 or 4 leaves, but, in the end, gave it 3.5 because when I looked back at what I read I didn't really like the ending and I would have loved to see more of Hayato and Hanayu. I actually had to re-read the last 3 pages for 3 times to prove to myself that those two stayed together. I really wanted to see their kid or a bit more affectionate those two. But well we get what we get. \n But let me elaborate a bit, so you are not so left out. Meet our main characters: Hanayu - she's the daughter of patisserie and wants to be a sushi chef, and we have Hayato on the other hand - the successor of Hyuga sushi shop, who wants to become patisserie. Perfect combination if you ask me. They just need to switch places and everything would be fine. Or just marry into each other's family. And well both of them had the similar ideas, but what if their plans are ruined or some of them have some obligations to fulfill? That's for you to find out how they actually reach their happy end. And believe me, they will, but not without many arguments, threats and even break ups. \n I loved this story. It was fast paced and fun, as always the author made a huge accent on the guys, drawing them really well. I didn't really care about Hayato, his and Hanayu's dads were drool worthy. Well, it's if you love Komura-sensei's art style. I got so used to it after reading Liar Lily that I found it very easy and fun to read. The biggest mystery was the gender of the culinary class teacher. So if you're new to this series, please share your hypothesis with me thanks! \n What else did I want to cover here? Oh, right. I actually bought all 8 volumes from book depository (the link is above) it's in English. But if you like reading online and prefer mangafox to mangahere, this time, you'll have to compromise. As on mangafox there're only 6 volumes while on mangahere are all 8. I had the similar happen in a few other mangas too. \n Are you ready to find out how Hanayu and Hayato reach their dreams? Don't forget that this is a cooking manga and you might find some useful recopies or just information there. I actually made a note to cook one of the things there. I hope you'll find some time to read this fantastic story, it does lack in the romance department, but it's still fun and interesting to read! Enjoy it to its fullest and don't forget to share your thoughts below! Stay tuned for more reviews as well as promos. Don't miss your next favourite book or manga!

Well, to be exact how the voice actors are chosen? If yes, this fabulous story is just for you! I have read it twice, and both times I loved it a lot. Though it lacks a bit the romance declaration from the main couple. Yup, in the whole 12 or so volumes there's not a single kissing scene. As you know, I always hate when the romance manga doesn't have at least one kiss. However, as you can see I loved it when I read it for the first time and even reread it for my liking. \n But, let me start from the very beginning. Meet our heroine - Hime a high-school freshman in a very specialized school. Her dream is to become a professional seiyu, meaning a person who dubs anime and video games. However, there's a problem, she has quite interesting voice and you'll need quite an imagination to recreate the sounds, but trust me as soon as you start reading the voices of each character will be coming alive. You don't believe me? Bad for you, you just need to start reading and you'll understand absolutely everything. \n The story focuses on how Hime got into the industry and fell in love with Senri. He's one great character and his story is something that develops fantastically and you want to know how his relationship with Sakura Aoyama (that's his mother) will go. To say the truth I wanted a bit more. I did love how Senri and Hime end up together, but I wanted to see at least their wedding, but nope I didn't get it. And plus I really wanted to see how Hime would act girl's roles, so far she only did men's ones. \n So, you are ready to get to know Hime, Senri and Mizuki? That's another character that you really need to get to know better! Enjoy it to its fullest and don't forget to share your thoughts below! Stay tuned for more reviews as well as promos.

Excellent ending to a run that started amazing, mushed a bit in the middle and then came back strong. Everything tied together really well.

I was glad to see Tony finally hitting back after so many years of everything going terribly, horribly wrong post-Civil War. Maria's response to how Mandarin got to Tony was a little understated, I thought, and I do wonder if there's any payout to that. The dispatching of the enemies was pretty well done, and followed good development. Though the Avengers never got called in, really? Great Reliant crew, love them cheering Tim's dating on. Tony's ideas about using Reliant software is pretty damn terrifying, though definitely in character--it's like he's learned nothing, though. Screw privacy rights? After his experiences with the rings? SIGH, Tony. Plus going back to hiding women from Pepper. Everything has reset. But hey, I finally finished the entire run, which was my goal for Read Harder.

I loved the book, and was a little anxious to see how it translated into a graphic novel. But I need not have been concerned. The creators of this adaptation have done a great job, and many of the scenes are exactly the way I pictured them. A virus kills everyone older than twelve, leaving children to fend for themselves. Lisa Nelson and her younger brother are somehow managing to survive, thanks to Lisa's ability to find food and supplies. But there are gangs nearby who want what Lisa and Todd have, and they take whatever they want. Lisa first forms a neighborhood coalition that she calls Grandville, but when the alliance fails, she decides to fortify a former school where those who follow her will be safe. Everyone has jobs to do, but Lisa feels responsible for everyone in the city. While Lisa is lucky enough to escape the clutches of her enemies, the story clearly shows that all across the country, there are several pockets of youngsters who rallying others around them. This graphic novel only hints at what may lie ahead for the survivors of the virus once they turn 12--or the emotional cost of being responsible for so many other dependents. Yet, what stood out in the original story and what stands out in this adaptation is Lisa's self-reliance and her determination to help others be self-reliant. While she and her friend Craig may have very different ways of leading their lives, both seek self-reliance. The title raises many questions; for instance, what will happen when all the available supplies run out? and what happens when the society with which we are familiar is turned on its head?", "date_added": "Sat Mar 03 15:51:43 -0800 2012", "date_updated": "Thu Jun 14 15:38:40 -0700 2012", "read_at": "Sat Mar 03 16:06:27 -0800 2012", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

Because none of the strips I remember as being quite good are actually any good at all. The ABC Warriors were, I thought, one of the better 2000AD series from my adolescence, and this book, The Meknificent Seven, is a collection of its opening story from 1979. While it's fun in parts, it's also mostly derivative (though some parts are clearly meant to be homages of one kind or another), and some of the writing is distinctly subpar in places. The art is mostly strong, though some artists were better than others. The ABC Warriors appeared a couple of times during the 1980s and 1990s, before being re-introduced in 1999 and continuing through to the present day.

It seemed to be excessively weird for the sake of being excessively weird, attempting to both repel and pull in mortified readers with cheap, over-the-top shock value. I wasn't particularly shocked by its imagery, but I did pause a few times to go \"Uh-huh.\" \n Then I kept reading, and I started to realize that this would be much better than the opening chapter suggested. And I was right. This got better with every passing chapter. By the end of this extremely gory and surreal affair, it's transcended its surface-level schlock to the level of 'damn-near masterpiece.' \n Basically, Lychee Light Club is about an underground cult consisting of students from an all-boys school. The group has three leaders/founders, but everyone seems to be controlled by the spectacles-wearing psychopath nicknamed 'Zera.' They all obey his every order with undying devotion as they strive to achieve his goal of creating a god-like robot, whom Zera names Lychee, after the flower (oh, and the flower provides Lychee with fuel, and is the only fuel source it can digest). On more than one occasion, these guys reminded me of the Nazis. Their personalities begin to flesh out a bit more as the story goes along, but none of them really step into redeemable territory--which is fine by me, since that's clearly not what Furuya was going for. \n So anyway, Zera orders Lychee to kidnap a beautiful girl, and after a few tries, Lychee brings a beautiful girl named Kanon to their lair. Everyone is forbidden from touching her. Lychee is tasked with guarding her. But after Lychee gets an upgrade, giving him the capacity to 'feel,' Lychee and Kanon spark up one of those lovely 'beauty and the beast' friendships that slowly turns into something more. \n I won't go into further detail about the plot, but I will say that despite the extremely deranged violence (the artwork details seem to be at their most thorough when someone's organs are literally splattering across the pages) and general sadism of its disturbed characters, Lychee Light Club has a surprising amount of heart in its concept and execution (pun intended). There isn't much logic applied here (I seriously doubt anyone could commit so many acts of murder and other crimes in such an apparently small district and not stir up rumours, at least). Given its mythological tone, I'm not too surprised by that. \n The story isn't anything new, but like many good stories, it takes its formula and thematic material, and mixes them into a new broth. A really fucked-up broth with lots of guts and poetic themes. \n Not for the faint of heart, and certainly not for everyone, but it is what it is, and it's surprisingly good at being just that.", "date_added": "Thu May 05 18:17:43 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Thu May 05 20:13:48 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Thu May 05 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Thu May 05 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

It only takes us to the end of book one of the Song of Ice and Fire, but then again, apparently the graphic novel is actually called A Game of Thrones, the official title of the first book of the series, and not Game of Thrones, the title of the all-encompassing TV show, so I guess I should have expected that. \n It's too bad. I wanted to use the graphic novels to brush up on the goings on in Westeros before the sixth book comes out, but they wouldn't have been ready anyway. I do hope they continue with the rest of the books someday. \n As I've said before, the artist is better with action scenes and fighting rather than with facial expressions, which I think is a drawback in Martin's universe, where political maneuvering is more common than battles. This final installment actually has a lot of battles, but Abraham follows Martin's lead in not always showing the action directly. In prose, this is good, because reading about many similar battles can get tedious, but if you have an artist that is better at drawing them than at drawing conversing characters, then it is perhaps not the best choice. \n Female characters especially tend to not be the best - Catelyn Stark looks like a fourteen year old boy in some panels.

The nefarious Emperor Zombie, undead occultist and former groundskeeper at Hyde Park, is up to his evil tricks again and so Honest Abe calls upon his top secret agent - the eponymous Screw-On Head - to save the day. Together with vampire concubine Madam and scientist Dr Snap, Emperor Zombie has stolen an ancient manuscript from the Museum of Dangerous Books and Papers that will guide him to the fabled Temple of Gung. [Gung being a warlord who very nearly managed to conquer the whole world over ten thousand years ago thanks to the supernatural powers he gained through ownership of \"a fabulous melon-sized jewel.\"] If he acquires the powers of Gung, no force on Earth will be able to stop Emperor Zombie. Fortunately, Screw-On Head, along with his manservant Mr Groin and his dog Mr Dog, is on the case. \n Growing from an idea that Mike Mignola had for an action figure, The Amazing Screw-On Head became one of the most successful one-shot comics in recent history, possibly even the most successful one-shot outside of the superhero genre. The style is reminiscent of Mignola's Hellboy of course, but The Amazing Screw-On Head is a delightful, if brief, steampunk romp from presidential offices to dusty laboratories, across Victorian rooftops to mouldering tombs via sojourns in airships. The story is uniquely bonkers yet peculiarly plausible as Mignola melds history together seamlessly with fantasy, throwing in some great gags along the way. The characters created for this story are delightful oddballs. Screw-On Head himself is a robotic head threaded like a light bulb so that he can be screwed into a variety of robot bodies that are each equipped with some handy gadgetry. Emperor Zombie and Mr Groin are also particularly strong creations. Mignola's art is every bit as good as his writing and The Amazing Screw-On Head is a visual treat, even the endpapers are a moody delight. \n The Amazing Screw-On Head is a fairly short story and so there is more to this volume that just that - there are five Other Curious Objects to enjoy too. The Magician and the Snake is a sombre vignette about the enduring relationship between an aging stage magician with the power to dissolve solid objects and his reptilian familiar. In Abu Gung and the Beanstalk we get to witness the warlord Gung (yep, the one whose magic jewel [!] was of supreme importance to Emperor Zombie) in his youth as he attempts to help two witchy sisters reverse the bad fortune heaped upon them by a Hellboy-esque chubby devil. The devil features again, albeit in a different disguise, in The Witch and her Soul as two peculiar puppets named Hankel and Manx must bargain for their future after their mistress's death. The collection head for outer space in The Prisoner of Mars as a Victorian gentleman [who may well seem familiar from The Amazing Screw-On Head] narrates to his friends an anecdote about how he came to murder a Martian-possessed colleague, was hanged for his crime, and ended up arriving in the afterlife encased in a Martian-built hovering robot shell. The final story in the collection is the wordless and spine tingling tale In the Chapel of Curious Objects where a variety of sinister puppets who may well turn up in future Mignola stories can be found. The Amazing Screw-On Head and Other Curious Objects is then nicely rounded off with some excerpts from Mignola's sketchbook. \n As a whole, The Amazing Screw-On Head and Other Curious Objects offers yet more astounding work from the genius that is Mike Mignola. Although the artwork has the darkly gothic realism that helps to make Hellboy such a hit, the stories here are far more humorous than in Mignola's flagship series. The Amazing Screw-On Head in particular is an all-out comedy that never misses with a gag. As long-time Mignola fans will expect, while the stories collected here are highly original, there is a great deal of mythological and folklore detail propping up his terrific tales. The Amazing Screw-On Head and Other Curious Objects is an absolute riot and I really can't recommend it highly enough.", "date_added": "Tue May 09 09:46:11 -0700 2017", "date_updated": "Tue May 09 09:46:24 -0700 2017", "read_at": "", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

I have to admit that I haven't heard of any of these. Many lies mentioned here were to discipline the children into good behaviour and healthy habits. \n I personally would prefer to explain children about the importance of brushing their teeth instead of threatening them that a police officer will inspect their toothbrush to check if they have brushed or not. I guess some kids simply cannot be convinced with reasoning and the adults have to deceive and scare them. So these kinds of lies make sense. \n What I don't get in this book is the point of certain lies that are deceptive for no valid reason. For instance, why would you tell a kid that one in five avocados have eyes? That just sounds mean. To me, this was a strange book because I couldn't really wrap my head around the whole idea of lying to kids.

A really great friend and librarian colleague of mine recently read this and loved it. I just kept seeing the flaws. \n I get that this came first. That it's a dystopian tale about all the adults dying and the kids having to figure out how to survive and it stars a GIRL and the original book came out in 1975. I totally like the feel of the art. And THE COLORING is freaking awesome. MAJOR props to Jenn Manley Lee. \n But here are my complaints... \n 1. Sizeism. Granted, food is hard to come by when society is falling down around your ears. But all of the major characters are thin and attractive. Also pretty darn diverse for Illinois. \n 2. Publishing quality. My quality had several pages slightly out of focus. Hate that. \n 3. Nit-picky Panel-level storytelling. There was one specific panel where I stopped and just couldn't believe that experienced graphic novelists had packed that much of an important speech at a pivotal moment into one tiny panel in the corner of a page (pg 16, bottom right). Take some time. Let her get a panel for each sentence. Using several panels spaces out how much time it's taking for the character to say the lines (some tips might be taken from Jason Shiga). Don't make us think about how much of a speech you're putting in one panel in the first place. \n Also, images are recycled, which always bugs me when I notice it (pg 119). Oh yeah, and the lettering isn't hand-drawn. Which bugs me. \n 4. Didacticism. Granted this came out in 1975, but I felt like it was screaming for an adult to ask the kid \"Do you think that the heroine was right or wrong to do what she did and claim what she claimed?\" I wanted some subplots to distract from the agenda. \n 5. Violence. Granted, I'm extrasensitive to anything that involves dogs, but I didn't like that the dogs were merely one more weapon and were trained to be vicious. Also, zero thought or attention was paid to how violent some of the kids defense methods were - guns galore, boiling oil, explosives... Violence doesn't normally bother me (I LOVE the Gone series by Michael Grant, for example), but in a book that felt so \"message-y\" I wanted there to be at least a nod to how violent the world became. Maybe it's in the prose. \n Honestly, I was shocked that the creators had the GN cred they did when I read their bios at the end. It felt like a project that was a publishers idea, in a bad way.

No, it's continuing on and with art in much the same style as the first arc of issues... \n I had been happy enough to give the bulk of these volumes 2 stars due to the accuracy of the adaptation. I can appreciate what they were trying to do, and the importance of good location/setting design in an artist. They adapted things well from a text standpoint and pacing standpoint, but the artwork distracted me too much to truly enjoy it. Unfortunately in this final volume the artwork distracted me to the point that I simply wanted to put the book down. \n Certain scenes with Dany and Eddard's dreams were rendered in what I'm guessing was meant to be a more artistic style that only succeeded in making the comic look more low-budget than it already did. Certain designs were just... lazy, and in long-shot panels some people even seemed to have lost their faces much like the Kindly Men. \n I'm glad I got through it, but man, it was rough.", "date_added": "Thu Oct 05 12:26:15 -0700 2017", "date_updated": "Thu Oct 05 12:44:36 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Thu Oct 05 15:59:37 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

Was it this fall that the physical copies had been sent out? Anyway, I haven't had time to read it before because I didn't want to carry that book all around with me by fear of damaging it. That's the thing, this book is of such great quality (same thing as A Redtail's Dream which I also have and loved), it's a real treasure. So yeah, I've waited for so long to read this because 1) like I said, I didn't have time and 2) I much prefer to read in paper-book format which is why I didn't read the webcomic as soon as I finished ARTD. \n That being said, I absolutely loved it. First, as I said for ARTD, Minna Sundberg's art is both incredibly cute and really pretty. I'm very fond of the colors in particular, the base colors change for each chapter (or part of the journey to be more precise) gives each new place a new atmosphere as you progress into the story. Speaking of which, the story might seem to progress slowly, but I think you appreciate the artwork much more this way. You have time to appreciate the details and immerse yourself into SSSS's world. It also gives space to develop the characters which is particularly interesting as each member of the team is quite peculiar in its own way which makes for priceless interactions between them all (Emil and Sigrun are hilarious and Lalli is so cute~ haha). Making each of them come from a different country, not speaking the same language and therefore not necessarily understanding each other was a huge challenge, but one that I believe Minna handled quite skillfully. \n And now I kinda both want to hop on the wagon, keep reading the webcomic now as it keeps being updated online, but also wait for the next physical book to be out (which could mean waiting for a very long time I guess).", "date_added": "Wed Sep 09 04:04:22 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Thu Dec 31 18:58:42 -0800 2015", "read_at": "Thu Dec 31 00:00:00 -0800 2015", "started_at": "Sun Nov 01 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

Kudos to that cruel bastard Bendis for reaching out through the pages and punching me in the gonads like that. What right, what sick impulse fuels this streak of ballsy fealty to \"good storytelling\"? \n I am happy to see the Spidey-verse continue to evolve, and for the various good & bad players to up their game - it's like they're actually learning human beings, which is so rare in Big Two comics (or so it appears over the decades). \n I'm happy enough with the art - it's well drawn, though not entirely inspired in layout or clarity of action (a goo monster does tend to keep things from having clean lines, admittedly) and there's a lot of ways this could've gone a lot worse so good on Pichelli for keeping up her standards.", "date_added": "Mon May 27 10:40:50 -0700 2013", "date_updated": "Sat Oct 12 15:51:25 -0700 2013", "read_at": "Sat Oct 12 15:51:25 -0700 2013", "started_at": "Sat Oct 12 00:00:00 -0700 2013", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

The boys are wild but obsessed with beauty, so they build a robot named Lychee to head out into the city and kidnap pretty girls for them. The leader of the boys is a brilliant but paranoid boy named Zera who rules over the group through terror. His obsession to stay leader and his paranoia create a nasty mix, as he starts suspecting everyone else in the club to be working against him. This is Lord of the Flies squeezed out through a sci-fi manga and works largely because the personalities of these kids seem so frighteningly real. Hyper-violent, with a fair amount of explicit sex, blood and even rape. So, needless to say, not for everyone. \n The plot is pretty predictable, but the art is gorgeous---albeit in a disturbing way. Vastly different from Genkaku Picasso, it's often dark, super-detailed and partnered with superior character design and powerful storytelling. I'm still digesting this in a lot of ways, so I may actually do a big blog post about this one.

To say that it's the most perfect comic ever produced would probably be hyperbole of the worst sort, but it's also shockingly close to how I actually feel, so there you go. \n First off, The Amazing Screw-On Head and Other Curious Objects represents the most new material written and drawn by Mignola that we've gotten in years. Plus, I hadn't read any of it prior to this release, though I read an online preview of \"The Magician and the Snake\" and I'd seen the animated pilot for the proposed Amazing Screw-On Head cartoon series. So this was all new to me. \n Also, Mignola is, as everyone knows, my favorite writer and artist, and this is 100% unfiltered Mignola doing what he loves best, without the constraints of having to fit anything into a coherent universe as he does in, say, his Hellboy comics. Now, usually stuff like this, sort of surreal, sort of comedic, is of less interest to me than stuff like Hellboy, but Mignola's take on it is completely delightful pretty much every step of the way. \n The title story is actually the least of the book's contents, as far as I'm concerned. It's great stuff, but the real winners are the new stories. Their art showcases Mignola at the top of his game, and they're great weird mythologizing of the first order. There are pages and panels in The Amazing Screw-On Head and Other Curious Objects that I could talk about at great length, but I'll restrain myself, at least for now. \n I've said elsewhere that I couldn't pick a favorite, but that's not true. It's not very productive to do so, since every story is virtually perfect, but my favorite is definitely \"The Witch and Her Soul,\" about which I love every line, every panel, and every image. \n Mignola has said of \"The Amazing Screw-On Head\" that it was a comic that he did just for him.

There are twists along the way, but they aren't that impressive. And the kicker is, you really only need to read the fourth chapter, because it recaps everything for you, explaining what's happened. \n I don't know about you, but there's holding the reader's hand and then there's tying them to a chair and spoon-feeding them. This is an example of the latter. \n A bunch of super-duper-powered cosmic-level characters who can't shake off the C-list status get together to save the universe... bit for some reason they're called \"The Annihilators.\" That's the one thing this book never explains. I suppose if they were to annihilate bad guys it might mean something, but they don't do that. \n In fact, the reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because their solution to the problem facing them isn't merely to punch it in the face (although there's a lot of that) but rather to figure out a compromise and to show compassion to characters who are doing bad things because of mental illness and misguided desires for justice. That's very atypical of these sorts of comics. \n Unfortunately, it's so heavy-handed that it doesn't work. Nice try, though. \n One of my main issues with the writing is that all the characters pretty much sound the same. Same tone, same inflection, identical verbiage. If you started a drinking game for every time someone said \"cut loose\" or \"alpha-level\" you'd be genuinely tipsy by the end of the book. I just can't imagine Ronan the Accuser and the Silver Surfer using \"cut loose\" in any context. \n That's the heart of the problem here: the idea is interesting but the execution is lazy. \n The second part of the book has to do with Rocket Raccoon and Groot having their own adventures. They're silly and the whole Lassie-and-Timmy-like exchanges get old after a while. \"I am Groot!\" \"What's that? Star-Thief has mesmerized everyone and stuck them in a holodeck?\" \"I am Groot.\" \"And you say we need to hatch a plan to save everyone?\" Oy.", "date_added": "Tue Aug 25 23:03:56 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Tue Aug 25 23:18:33 -0700 2015", "read_at": "Wed Aug 26 23:18:33 -0700 2015", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

It's not just web-slinging around or occasionally getting into a dust up with someone tough, it's generally filled with death of loved ones. Original Peter Parker (I won't even attempt to keep up with the various versions over the years) lost his parents, his Uncle Ben who was like a father to him, Gwen Stacy, and I'm sure in different versions he's lost other loved ones as well. Far be it for Ultimate Spider-Man comics to give the new kid a break from the difficulty of being Spider-Man. \n In earlier volumes Miles Morales already lost his Uncle The Prowler and in this volume Venom comes to his front door. I don't mean old school Venom: \n aka Spider-Man with a creepy tongue and sharp teeth. I mean this Venom \n which is sort of a creepy venom and the alien from the Alien movies hybrid. Yeah new Venom would probably make most people pee themselves if it was real. \n So Venom believes that Jefferson Davis, Miles' Dad, is the new Spider-Man because a reporter who might as well have had dollar signs in her eyes jumped to that conclusion. She carefully scrutinized the film of Spider-Man versus The Prowler and plans on cashing in by telling the world Jefferson Davis is Spider-Man, but before she can get her book deal Venom came by to say hello with that nasty tongue of his. \n Drama ensued a lot of people got hurt and it may be more than the 13 year old Miles can handle.", "date_added": "Fri Sep 04 11:03:38 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Mon Sep 07 15:01:14 -0700 2015", "read_at": "Mon Sep 07 16:52:20 -0700 2015", "started_at": "Sun Sep 06 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "n_votes": 16, "n_comments": 0}

The author focus on the meaning of the story, and tries to find a sense in the main plot just as in the minor events, putting all pieces together, and really helps to understand something. At least, he presents many of the even more possible interpretations. He doesn't spend much time in analyzing and reporting all of the quotes that is possible to discover in the comic, which is good because a work like that would have been too time-consuming and somehow sterile, risking to lose the general and important meaning getting lost among details.

However, I only read the first three volumes of the series to read this last one because I was interested in reading more Superior Spider-man adventures. Sadly, my efforts were somewhat wasted since it is not necessary to read the first three volumes to read the last one, there isn't much or any continuity between them. Each issue within the series is self contained rather than building up a single story arc. \n This volume is all about Superior Spider-man which means, in case you have been living under a rock, the body and mind of Spider-man is inhabited by Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock aka Doctor Octopus. Personally I have enjoyed this body switch, it was interesting to see what a villain would do with the great power and great responsibility of Spidey. Plus, I like Doc Ock, he has always been my favorite Spider-man foe, SUCK IT GREEN GOBLIN. \n Anyways, in this volume we have.... \n Spidey and the X-Men take on giant mutant spider \n In my opinion, this is the strongest story. It has the X-Men and Wolverine which provides lots of opportunities for friction and it is the story that I think best illustrates the difference between Parker's Spider-man and Otto's superior version. Otto's Spider-man is ruthless but he gets stuff done. He is more concerned about the ends than the means and it is often shocking to both the reader and the other characters. Gasp, Spider-man would never be so violent and abrasive! \n Spidey babysits the Future Foundation \n Once again we slip into the realm of the ridiculous. Spider-man is called in to babysit the Future Foundation... \n Okay this story wasn't that bad but come on, this is a plot for a juvenile comic. Lame. \n Spidey saves Thor from Electro \n Spidey and Sleepwalker \n Who the hell is Sleepwalker? He seems ridiculous. \n Overall, this is one of the better volumes of the series but that still doesn't make it a must read.", "date_added": "Wed Jan 08 12:27:46 -0800 2014", "date_updated": "Thu Oct 09 09:16:44 -0700 2014", "read_at": "Sun Oct 05 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "started_at": "Wed Mar 05 00:00:00 -0800 2014", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

However, the show has clearly influenced a lot of the character art; this is not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd have liked to see this published before the show's construction. That way we would get a more original representation of certain characters. \n I am glad that this is the final instalment of the graphic novels. I love the books; I love and hate the television show, but together they provide all of Martin's universe that you need. With this graphic novel it becomes a little overkill. I do, however, believe that I would have enjoyed this series more had I read it before I'd seen the television show. Don't get me wrong, these graphic novels are very good, but after reading the original novels and watching the show they feel unnecessary. They are the poorest of the three representations, and came when too late in the game. By now, these are tiresome. They were fun when they first came out, but the world has gone Game of Thrones mad at the moment. \n The Artwork \n Overall, the quality of the artwork is very high, some of the scenery is very good in particular, and I think Dany's story is drawn well. But, some of the characters do follow the same body and face shape, which makes them look like carbon copies of each other. Rob Stark, in this edition, looks exactly like Ned Stark but with red hair, which is very odd. They even look the same age. When Rob is on horseback with Cat they look like they could be a couple, which is quite disturbing. I liked the representation of Tyrion and Tyrin; the awkward relationship between father and son transferred well into this form, and the artist impression of Shae was very nice. \n Reading these graphic novels, and The World of Ice and Fire, has kept me sated whilst I patiently await A Winds of Winter. But, I do ardently hope that this last instalment of the graphic novels marks the last of the A Song of Ice and Fire side projects that have helped to put of the release of the one we've all been waiting for. Surely this graphic novel is the last thing to be released by George R.R Martin between now and A Winds of Winter. Well, one can hope.", "date_added": "Sat May 09 05:25:58 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Wed Mar 09 14:00:23 -0800 2016", "read_at": "Sat May 09 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 31, "n_comments": 2}

I know I've only started reading and reviewing Batman comics as a religion since last April of this year and that quest tested my diligence and adherence to a routine, but it also paid off. Now I've finally developed a keener sense of what works and what doesn't and the previous issue was a great example of the latter. This time, thankfully enough, the third issue was more satisfactory in scope and execution when it came to its storytelling pacing. \n Must I mention again how much of an anal retentive I am when it came to pacing? It's probably the most underappreciated and overlooked element of a story but when played just right, the symphony of notes comes together with ease that you just lose yourself in the moments and characters. \n This issue is a testament to that. \n +++++++SPOILERS TERRITORY, Y'ALL+++++++ \n There are three plotlines and they blended well together: \n (1) Stephanie Brown having a supposedly normal night but then she stumbles upon her father dressed as a supervillain among other like-minded individuals and now she's in some shitty danger. \n (2) Batman pursues leads and confronts the motherfucking Oswald \"Penguin\" Cobblepot; followed shortly after by a gang war erupting from the sidelines. \n (3) The GCPD is in a clusterfuck after losing their Commissioner to a frame-up, and now an unlikely leader steps in to lead them to more shitloads of chaos they won't be able to contain. \n FUCK IT. This is a fantastic issue, lots of action and thrill, filled with more plot set-ups that define the high-staked pay-offs for the future installments (hopefully). And this is the tone that I wish Batman Eternal will keep up with because it's deliriously enjoyable for me. \n Let's talk about Stephanie Brown first. I believe this is her re-appearance in the New 52 continuity and from what I can remember, what happened here is pretty much in line with what was established of her character from the original canon. Even if there are two other major things happening in the issue, her story didn't feel forced or distracting. It seemed essential enough, taking up enough space without it being overdone. I'm curious what role her father will play once the chips have fallen and the game has turned with a more decisive stroke. For now, I'm content seeing Brown ran around trying to get away from her own psycho family. I feel terrible for her, honestly. It's like she just stepped into a waking nightmare, no preparations whatsoever. The suspense feel of her pages was handled superbly because of this tension. \n As for the GCPD storyline, it directly connects with the reveal that Mayor Hady and the still-elusive Carmine Falcone are back to working together just like the old times (where 'cops ruled as kings and mobs flourished alongside them', UGH). They also appointed Jack what's-his-face (I despise him profusely since issue #1) to lead the police force and the asshole's numero uno goal is to hunt down Batman. Everything suddenly feels reminiscent of the old times, indeed and it makes me sick to my stomach. There was that amusing scene when Jack drew the Bat-symbol on the whiteboard SO PERFECTLY in his first attempt. Has he been practicing drawing that symbol all this time in case he gets to do it in front of his associates? I suppose we will never know. \n Lastly, we see Batman kicking ass and taking names, just the way we always like him doing. Playing detective is one of his strongest suits as long as the writing demands and supplies it beautifully, and this issue has done so. Penguin is utterly delightful, chastising a female employee in a bunny costume with his casual air of douchebaggery when Batman rudely interrupts. Penguin is shocked to learn that his nemesis Falcone is back. Just as soon as Batsy leaves, he begins to gather the troops to prepare for any oncoming attack...and the first wave of that heat happens by the closing pages. It's spectacular. \n SHIT IS ABOUT TO GET REAL! \n On a final note, Jason Fabok and the colorist Brad Anderson have done supremely well for the illustrations of this issue. The sequential storytelling as a whole, in spite of the bulk of the panels and scenes, never feels like it's been crammed up. A small thing I noticed is Bullock who looks...PRETTY and that's sort of jarring to look at. Nevertheless, the visuals are just plain cool. \n I asserted that five writers working on story is definitely like having too many cooks in the kitchen and we saw the consequence of the ingredients being tossed around poorly in the previous issue. But they immediately came back with a better grip of things and that makes me happy. I trust that they keep this up! If they do, then it won't be so hard for me to read and review the next issues. \n RECOMMENDED: 9/10 \n DO READ MY BATMAN COMICS REVIEWS AT:", "date_added": "Mon Oct 20 00:28:17 -0700 2014", "date_updated": "Tue Oct 17 03:14:14 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Mon Oct 20 09:27:33 -0700 2014", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

The first story is based on a toy idea Mignola had - like him, I would certainly buy such a thing. A robot head with a light-bulb base! Interchangable bodies! Most fascinating! In this one-shot, Screw-on Head is an hero called upon by President Lincoln to stop a nepharious plot by the Emperor Zombie. Both characters are terribly inept and silliness ensues. It's a fun story, particularly the dialogue between Screw-on Head and his unflappable butler. I do so love a butler. \n The rest of the stories are very short, most having appeared previously in various anthologies. The most notable is \"The Prisoner of Mars\" because, let's face it, who can resist a story about the afterlife and aliens? \n Mignola's artwork continues to be distinctive and readily recognizable. I love the saturation of color, as well as the harsh lines and liberal use of shadow. His panels look both rough and amazingly detailed, and I'm always fascinated by what he can convey without having to zero in on his characters' facial expressions. \n Apparently, this one has been made into an animated short - with Paul Giamatti and David Hyde Pierce lending their voice talents to the piece.

Trina Robbins really did a good job as editor, as this book feel like a who's who of the first generation of underground/alternative female comics artists in the US. \n The comics range from autobiographical to dystopian sci-fi, with everything imaginable in between. And the styles are all over the place, from Robbins' retro-looking clean lines to Aline Kominksy's highly personal, scratchy style. Having read several of the original issues of Wimmen's Comix, where the quality of the contributions varied much more, I can see how Robbins chose well among all the comics, and also complemented the mix with comics from other sources to get a well-balanced anthology. \n The stories that grabbed me the most when reading were ones that were based on history and real life, as in Lee Mars' all too short comic about her moonshine making grandmother, or Dot Bucher's biography of the great Harriet Tubman. Oh, and the earlier mentioned Kominksy's autobiographical story about her early life is scary and hilarious at the same time. \n This anthology is a historical document, as it shows just what alternative female comics artists were creating in the US in the 1970s, but it is also, still a good read.", "date_added": "Wed Nov 26 12:32:17 -0800 2014", "date_updated": "Fri Nov 28 03:00:13 -0800 2014", "read_at": "Wed Nov 26 14:22:29 -0800 2014", "started_at": "Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 -0800 2014", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

It was created by two comics artists from Norway, brought together by the fact that they were invited to take part in a comics festival in Moscow. They tell the story of this trip, taking turns to draw sequences in rather different styles, giving their sometimes conflicting views of what was going on. \n So far this is nothing out of the ordinary. In the journal I edit, Bild & Bubbla, we constantly publish comics reportage from various comics festivals around the world. What makes this one special is partly the book length of it, partly the fact that Russia is such an interesting place that the story deals with everyday life in general and the political situation in particular, rather than the actual comics festival - which is a good thing. \n The end is pure allegorical fantasy, with the artists being swept away for a day of fun and laughter with the great man Putin himself, and Putin falling in love with the male artist and mourning them being kept apart, thus explaining him advocating the new law of not allowing homosexuals to display their affection openly. I guess going to such a political hotbed means that you can't avoid being political yourself. \n Anyway, reading this at the time of the very controversial Olympics in Russia was great fun, and even though this is not a master piece in any way, the sheer joy of telling stories that Moskva overflows with makes it a worthwhile read.", "date_added": "Sat Feb 22 05:22:33 -0800 2014", "date_updated": "Sun Jun 22 07:40:34 -0700 2014", "read_at": "Sat Feb 22 00:00:00 -0800 2014", "started_at": "Sat Feb 22 00:00:00 -0800 2014", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

There's also a second story featuring Rocket Raccoon and Groot having their own adventure. \n Reading this immediately after Abnett and Lanning's epic storylines like War of Kings and The Thanos Imperative was probably a bad idea because it seems distinctly small in comparison to those. It definitely feels limited for a story that features several heavy-weight heroes like this, and I found the sub-plot of Quasar's lack of self-confidence more annoying than anything. Yeah, yeah. You died. Who hasn't in this universe? Get over it and go punch somebody. \n The bonus story with Rocket and Groot was a lot more fun, but it did seem a little too cartoonish. I know it's a talking raccoon and a walking tree and this is actually touches on several points from the original run of Rocket's mini-series from the mid '80s, but Guardians of the Galaxy always gave these characters some genuine weight. While there are good moments like seeing that Rocket was so badly stunned by the events of Thanos Imperative that he has given up galaxy saving for a job as a mail room clerk, the art style and several goofy elements undercut both him and Groot as serious superheroes who have helped save the universe.", "date_added": "Tue Jul 01 09:46:05 -0700 2014", "date_updated": "Wed Jul 02 12:04:27 -0700 2014", "read_at": "Wed Jul 02 13:23:23 -0700 2014", "started_at": "Wed Jul 02 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "n_votes": 19, "n_comments": 0}

Abnett & Lanning's cosmic Marvel stuff has been some of my favorite stuff I've read in recent years, and this seemed like it was going to be a great addition. Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Gladiator, Ronan the Accuser and Quasar all teaming up together? That's probably the most powerful super team of all time. I was expecting big, flatout insane superheroics to match the ridiculousness of this team, but I think ultimately it just wasn't possible. These guys can practically bend time and space by sheer force of will. There just isn't an enemy that seems like a realistic threat for them, and that becomes clear over the course of the book. I just never felt like there were any real stakes, because they were able to quickly solve pretty much every problem, often by doing some crazy thing that doesn't even get explained. \n As a bonus, Abnett & Lanning have also included \"Rocket Raccoon & Groot,\" which follows the duo's adventures after the dissolution of the Guardians of the Galaxy at the end of The Thanos Imperative. It's written in a style that at first seems to want to be funny (and is, for the most part), but then also kind of seems like it wants to be a fairly serious origin story for Rocket. I loved the art in this one, but the story is just too all over the place to ever really take hold. I never quite understood how I was meant to feel about anything, and I wasn't a big fan of one certain revelation about Groot himself. \n Overall, this just isn't a great entry in the cosmic pantheon. I really wish Abnett & Lanning had just brought it all to a close with the Thanos Imperative, rather than going out with a couple of lackluster followups that have no real bearing on the rest of the stuff they've worked so hard to build.

After thoroughly breaking down the Avengers status quo in Disassembled, Bendis laid the groundwork to do what he really wanted to do with the Avengers: bring them into the modern world. The title \"New Avengers\" seems incredibly fitting, as it's still definitely an Avengers book, but in a much more current, post-Iraq mindset. The villains aren't as cut-and-dried, and it's not clear what the best solution is to any given conflict. This is a fairly well-trod concept in 2014, but Bendis kind of pushed mainstream comics in that direction almost by himself back in 2005 with these stories. \n The character work in this book is almost perfect. Each character has a very unique, specific, and most importantly human voice, with the banter reminding me a lot of the Avengers movie: very real with a bit of comic flare. Bendis had been writing Ultimate Spider-Man for a while at this point, so his Spidey stuff is super on point (particularly compared to the mostly-shitty stuff JMS was doing concurrently in Amazing Spider-Man). He gives Captain America a solid edge of authority mixed with compassion that works better than a lot of Cap stuff I've seen. These points, combined with the thrilling-but-straightforward plotting, make a book that is a breeze to read while still feeling complex. \n The only minor quibble I have with the book is its portrayal of Jessica Drew (Spider Woman), the only female Avenger thus far. I know these complaints have been levied against comics for years now, but she sometimes comes across very much as a sex object. However, here's the thing: it kind of feels like it's intentional? As in, maybe Bendis intentionally overly sexualized this character as a commentary on over-sexualized female characters, rather than just to blatantly do it. Here's my reasoning: nothing Jessica ever does is blatantly sexual, it's all in how she's viewed by the males in the book. Granted, she does wear a ridiculously tight spandex suit, and she's drawn as the most voluptuous woman this side of Power Girl, but she herself does not act sexual in this book. Characters comment several times on \"how hot\" she is, and she's even slightly capable of controlling men with her attractiveness, but she almost comes across as embarrassed of these abilities and the fact that they work so well. So, having not read any of the rest of New Avengers, I'm looking forward to how Bendis proceeds with Spider Woman, to see if this is a commentary, or if it's more stuff written for horny dudes. In any case, there is still more to her character than these traits, so there's that at the very least. \n Another positive aspect of this book is Bendis's dialogue. He's long been a love-him-or-hate-him writer in this regard, but I feel like for New Avengers he really nailed his style. There's quips and side jokes and lots of (sometimes too much) talking, but it always flows organically during the scenes rather than just feeling like big blocks of time wasting text. This lets the book flow incredibly well, like watching a great action movie or something. \n I know every comics person has already read this, but if you haven't, you really should. This is some of the most solid superhero stuff I've read in a long time.", "date_added": "Wed Jul 24 19:18:41 -0700 2013", "date_updated": "Sat Jul 05 13:44:47 -0700 2014", "read_at": "Sat Jul 05 14:58:39 -0700 2014", "started_at": "Wed Jul 02 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "n_votes": 3, "n_comments": 2}

As a long-time Star Trek fan, I welcome (almost) any addition to the universe created by Gene Roddenberry, and I find it refreshing that the last movie inspired so many fans to once again embrace their 'inner geek' so openly at the box office even though the franchise long ago ran the risk of beating a dead horse. Or a dead Klingon Targ. Or a dead Gorn. Take your pick. However, there's still something remarkably endearing to the various incarnations of Star Trek that came before, and I'm hoping that the kind folks at IDW Comics continue to bring us the welcome visits to \"where no one has gone before\" that they've been providing since they picked up the rights to produce comic books within the established continuity of Paramount Pictures' juggernaut franchise. \n STAR TREK: ALIEN SPOTLIGHT (Volume 1) is a stunning visual treat for the eyes and the best form of imaginative candy for the brain. Published in 2008, this graphic novel compilation collects six tales from the Star Trek universe with each chapter specifically focusing on a specific alien culture mostly unique to Trek's true origins, \"TOS\" (aka \"The Original Series,\" for those in-the-know). Specifically, these writers and artists concern themselves with tales regarding the Gorn, the Vulcans, the Andorians, the Orions, the Borg, and the Romulans. (The Borg were first seen during STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION's television run; otherwise, the remaining five species were first explored in the original TV show.) Besides some absolutely stellar artwork and characterization, what works best in these stories is the fact that each one tries (and, for the most part, succeeds) in exploring what distinguished these species culturally from humans ... what makes them different, what makes them 'tick', what makes them worthy of having a narrative with a decidedly alien focus. \n No credible review would be complete without a quick plot summary, and I'm sure serious Trek aficionados will appreciate a rundown. \"The Gorn\" is set in the timeframe before STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, when Captain Terrell, Commander Chekov, and the crew of the Reliant crashlanding a shuttlecraft on a Gorn-occupied planet. \"The Vulcans\" is set in the timeframe of the starship Enterprise's Captain Christopher Pike facing his crews discomfort over having the first Vulcan officer in Starfleet - Mr. Spock - serving aboard his ship. \"The Andorians\" revisits the days of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and focuses almost entirely on Commander Sharad - an Andorian serving within Starfleet who returns to his homeworld only to find himself an outcast for embracing the ideals of the Federation. \"The Orions\" takes us to a time when Christopher Pike has been promoted to Fleet Captain, and is serving out his days mostly in an ambassadorial capacity; his visit to the infamous world, Babel, treats him up to an uneasy alliance with a beautiful but deadly Orion assassin. \"The Borg\" takes place (somewhat) during Captain Jean Luc Picard's cinematic adventures, with the Borg further attempting to assimilate mankind; this time out, their weapon is a temporal weapon that allows the Collective the ability to manipulate time. Lastly, \"The Romulans\" re-visits characters and situations previously postulated from the original series excellent episode, \"Balance of Terror\"; this chapter serves as a prequel to events unfolding in that episode, and it is a must for fans of Old School Star Trek. \n The artwork is terrific. Colors are intense, and they lift these stories off the page. The writing is particular strong; the only story that lags a bit focuses on \"The Borg,\" and that's mostly because there was a wealth of material plugged into what was a single-issue tale, one that could've easily been expanded upon into several issues or, perhaps, even a stand-alone novel. The strongest tales here are, arguably, those centered around the Romulans and the Andorians, and that's largely because those two one-shots visit the worlds in question. I would imagine that it's a rare occasion for a writer to visit these alien worlds - neither Andoria or Romulus has been given great exposure in any incarnation of Star Trek - so I can only guess that these writers were thrilled to do so in this graphic format. Not often do you get to play in a universe as vast as Star Trek, and clearly these storytellers took great advantage to spin yarns worth all of the ink. Established characters get great screen time here, and lesser or new characters make splendid additions. Quite frankly, the simple lines of costumes and sets have never looked better than they do in his magnificent IDW production. \n What I found most endearing about this first volume - besides the fact that the title automatically implies that a second volume is on the way - is the fact that, much like Roddenberry himself expressed so eloquently with his TV show, differences between races are not so very distinct when measured against circumstances. Every race in the galaxy has honor. Every race experiences love and hate in its own way. Every race has triumphs and losses, and, when we're searching for the core message at the heart of these morality plays, it follows a very simple precept: \n \"We're all human.\"", "date_added": "Fri Apr 01 09:56:39 -0700 2011", "date_updated": "Fri Apr 01 09:57:21 -0700 2011", "read_at": "Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 -0700 2011", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

I absolutely hate the way the characters are drawn. They all look the same, you can't tell ages and the women all look too pouty. I think this would have been a much better adaptation with a different artist. You can see the influence of the tv show on the way some of the characters are drawn, but not others.

I liked Civil War but at the same time it's good to see a friendly game of poker rather than brutal fights to the death. Similarly, the Thing is determined that they can all get out of Arcade's \"Murderworld\" without anyone dying; compare and contrast to Avengers Arena... \n There are some very funny scenes in this, particularly involving Lockjaw. It's also good to see the GLX again, and Squirrel Girl's team-up was great. \n I've never been a huge fan of the Fantastic Four, but they come across well in this: in particular, Reed gets to display his intelligence, rather than us being told that he's smart. (He gave a very clear explanation of the \"phone number with missing digits\" problem.) \n The artwork is good too. It's quite cheerful, but still detailed enough to show the characters' emotions.

I get the feeling his world keeps getting bigger, while Kyoko's stays more or less the same. I can see why she joined the tennis club not long after becoming Maison Ikkoku's manager, because I see her as someone who could use more variety in her activities and acquaintanceship. \n The creepy \"Kyoko is sleeping, drunk, or otherwise incapacitated or off her guard, so I could grope her\" sexism continues, but as I recall author Takahashi dials back on that as the series goes along. Thank goodness. \n Kyoko and Godai are finding themselves drawn to each other, but are also wanting to play the field a bit before they commit. Both of them can be irrational and unthinkingly hypocritical when they grow jealous of the other's dates, dinners, etc. with people of the opposite sex who aren't themselves. \n But as always with this author's work, the jabs aren't delivered with scorn or derision, but with an indulgent understanding that we all can be just that silly sometimes. \n One of my favorite episodes is in this volume: the one where the pay phone is installed in the boarding house's hallway. A pay phone, you say? How old-fashioned! Well, this is a story written almost four decades ago. But Kyoko and Godai's Horrible Misunderstanding centered around land-line phone calls, exacerbated by the meddling of the other tenants in Maison Ikkoku, could well have played out exactly the same way if the two had been on social media instead.

In this volume which includes several other stories with similar themes, Mike Mignola describes how he created the story based on the idea of a childrens toy robot with different bodies and a scew-on head. There are several new stories added to this volume. \n You could say that many of these stories satirize steampunk which is often very satirical. The stories have a dreamlike quality to them. The villains have a ridiculous theme to them; Emperor Zombie, Dr. Sharp, Gung The Magnificent, the bug eyed martians, and the monster at the top of the beanstalk. \n The drawings use lots of dark shadows, browns, blacks, and reds. They look somewhat like the Hellboy comics which Mike Mignola draws, but with a much less malevolent feeling to them. The stories have a fable or fairytale quality to them. The heros are more odd and curious than heroic. \n The stories made me smile. They were magical, filled with irrational objects, and worth laughing at.

It's a hundred years since the virus first manifested and life should finally be getting back to normal for the survivors. Lacking all impulse control, the crossed have largely died out, except for the odd cell here and there. But in Moore's initial volume, a team of survivors out digging for history and remnants of the old society came across hints that maybe, just maybe, there's a hidden society of super-crossed, who have managed to keep some of their worst impulses in check (murder, cannibalism, incest), just enough to survive and prosper. Here, it's pretty much all-out war as it becomes apparent that an army of the crossed has been making \"deals\" with a number of isolated settlements: hand over 10 people a year, and the rest can stay alive. The survivors of a number of settlements that refused to give in have descended upon Murfreesboro, and things are about to get even more serious. This comic is a challenge to read, because of the future speak that Moore came up with and that Spurrier refines, but after awhile, you kind of get the hang of it and it isn't all that hard to follow what's going on. Spurrier's Crossed: Wish You Were Here was one of the strongest storylines in this entire universe and what he does here in volume 2 has me very optimistic to see what will come in volume 3. Scary, depressing, yet ultimately hopeful post-apocalyptic storytelling.", "date_added": "Mon Jul 31 17:04:01 -0700 2017", "date_updated": "Mon Jul 31 17:12:08 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

A virus strikes Europe, and to combat it, most of the Scandinavian countries close their borders (specifically Iceland blocks all incoming and outgoing traffic from the island). 90 years later, a ragtag team of 5 explorers ventures into Denmark, pass the quarantine zone and into the unexplored space that has been run-over by monsters and nature. \n The series starts well before any of this happens, with a countdown, first by days and then by weeks, months and years of the virus spreading. It follows a plethora of characters from all over Scandinavia, focusing mostly on Iceland. This first part was interesting, as we get to see how ordinary people deal with the spread of an unknown virus; some don't take it seriously, others are annoyed, some are terrified and some are all to prepared for the possibility of the world ending. I found the numerous characters pleasant, but I didn't really connect to any of them, because they were all blonde white Nords, who got a few pages of screen-time and were essentially there as mouthpieces to explain how the world ended. \n The story really picks up after 90 years, with the formation of the team. Its pretty clear from the start that the group is poor, ill-prepares and somewhat dishonest in their intentions for 'exploring' No-Man's-Land. This lends a lot of tension to the proceedings, because we know the characters may not be prepared for what is expecting them, and it helps that readers don't know what is expecting them either. We read about the monsters well before we see one, so the first time it happens the scene is extremely tense and well drawn. \n This leads me to a slight issue I'm having with this story, and that is it's tone. It's mostly light, with lots of jokes and characters underselling their reactions. This is a world that is barely surviving, most of mankind has been erased and yet they keep living their lives. That's a dark gruesome sentiment, but the comic never really acknowledges it. There are scenes that are downright horrifying, like Sigrun stumbling onto the death-room, or the Icelandic military destroying a civilian vessel full of children for getting to close to their shore. Yet in the next moment we are back to joking around about bruises giving you skin cancer and eating sardines. \n Additionally, it takes a really, really long time before anything really happens in the series. Don't get me wrong, this comic is gorgeous, with amazing, stunning artwork that is dripping in detail and atmosphere. The landscapes are beautiful the designs of the monsters and horrifying and creative, and each panel is full of little touches, like the heads of speakers appearing in world balloons when characters who are talking aren't on screen, or a flag denoting what language they are speaking in. \n However, we spend the first 70 pages with characters that are irrelevant, and we only really get to Denmark around 100 pages in. By the time we actually really experience the world, I was tempted to give up; we get pages upon pages devoted to world-building, geography, languages, but no real reason to care other than the curiosity of it. Despite this, things like the existence of magic and mages are not explained? The monsters are called giants and trolls, but they are still clearly just animals who are infected with the virus and mutated into Thing from Another World lookalikes. But the existence of people with superpowers blessed by Freya? Never addressed. \n I'm tempted to say that the story may have flowed better page by page, but I was marathoning this in two goes, and I had a lot of trouble keeping up with the characters and plot, despite nothing really happening. \n Let's quickly go over the characters. The main five are: Tuuri and Lalli, two Finnish cousins, one of whom is a mechanic and the other one a mage and a scout; Emil a Swedish boy who is a soldier and explosives expert; Sigrun, a Norwegian woman who is another soldier and Mikkel a Danish healer and soldier. I liked all of them and they are decently distinct from each-other. Tuuri is smart, young and very curious, speaks and reads all the Scandinavian languages including Danish, and gets easily excited. Mikkel is the grumpy deadpan 'dad' of the group, Sigrun is also overly excited and the defecto leader who is the most experienced in fighting the monsters. The two I liked the most, and cared the most about were Lalli and Emil. Emil is the one with the clearest character arc, since he starts off spoiled and cowardly, but also cares deeply about the others and gets drawn to Lalli, who is quiet, weird and a loner. Lalli for his parts speaks little, goes off alone, has strange dreams and is the least in touch with technology or other parts of the world. The two make and interesting pair, I'm looking forward to seeing how they get developed. \n The world, as I said is amazing and truly well thought out and presented. We get a lot of additional pages explaining the different languages, religions, customs, as well as some of the history of the past 90 years. There is a lot of culture clash which was fun to play with; the different nationalities had different customs and quirks which had only become more pronounced in the 90 years of isolation they had lived through. I especially appreciated the language barrier; the reason Lalli speaks so little is because he only speaks Finnish, while the others don't, apart from Tuuri. There were things missing, like the mage thing, and at times it did feel like I was sitting in a history class on Scandinavia, rather than a story, but that honestly became less and less of a problem the more into the story I got. \n I will continue reading books 2 and 3 of this series because I'm curious to see this world again, if nothing then for the gorgeous art. The story has potential and if there is something I'm hoping for it's more characters and less world-building (or a better integration of the two). Other than that, it's worth checking this series out, for sure, especially if you like fantasy that is set in our world.", "date_added": "Fri Sep 01 11:47:57 -0700 2017", "date_updated": "Thu Sep 14 20:39:23 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Thu Sep 14 19:55:38 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Fri Sep 01 11:47:58 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

After all, Nanami and all her friends are heading out on a high school trip, the cliche of shojo manga for funny hijinks and romantic moments. \n I adore Kamisama Kiss for a variety of reasons, not the least of which for its delightful character development. We've gotten to know Himemiko, Kurama, and Yukiji's stories. We've even gotten to see Mizuki's Yonomori before her village no longer needed her. Now, we are getting to know Nanami's friends a little more as their roles expand in the story. Ami has been kidnapped and Nanami braves all to rescue her friend. \n True to form, Nanami jumps into situations without truly thinking through all the repercussions. And, while she has grown as a kamisama, she still has a lot to learn. Tomoe is bound to her more strongly than ever as evidenced by his desire to learn to live in the human world, but it feels like Nanami forgets that she is no longer living for just herself anymore. She's neglecting her fox, and I'm already concerned that her lifespan is shortened now that she no longer has Ryu-oh's eye. Add that to what happens with Akura-oh, and I'm worried that we're going to see a flip in the story where Tomoe will need to go to great lengths to save Nanami this time. She is a kamisama, though, so perhaps her life is protected. Time will tell.

Add in the devoted fan base, some who've been with the series since 1996 and some who joined in when the TV series premiered, and you have a lot to live up to. \n The plot adaptation is so-so, though in all fairness I'm not sure anyone else could have done better (or worse). The writers leave in the key plot points but I still think that readers who are completely new to the material will be lost. Other important pieces are not as clear as they should be - for example, readers familiar with the story know what's happening when Yoren starts shouting \"Boy!\" to Arya Stark as he prevents her from watching a certain execution. Newbies won't have a clue, as the story isn't clear. \n Where I feel it completely fails is in the artwork. I couldn't tell who the fudge anyone was. Age is impossible to determine. Robb Stark looks older than his mom. Sansa is indistinguishable from Lady Catelynn. Jon Snow looks like a Victorian dandy who fell into a pool of ink. All of the characters have angry moments, and in those moments they are all draw as if very constipated. \n Such a shame. The earlier volumes had nice artwork and there are clearly talented ASOIAF artists out there - I continue to be mesmerized as I peruse the pages of The World of Ice & Fire: The Untold History of Westeros and the Game of Thrones.

It will be devastated and reborn into something new and strange. Ninety years later a small team will venture out of the safety of the limited surviving civilizations to see what else is left. \n Stand Still, Stay Silent has a unique approach to the post-apocalyptic genre and a very intriguing world centered on the Nordic countries. The comic is extremely atmospheric, and a lot of effort clearly went into the detail of how the different nations made it through and the cultural effects. \n The pacing is a big issue though. Even as a fan of deliberate stories I found this to be excruciatingly slow, not really picking up consistently until the end. I appreciate a gradual build of tension, but a fifty page prologue set before the fall followed by a hundred plus pages of introducing the actual cast is too much. Particularly when the prologue tries to feature so many different characters (who we'll never see again) that it somehow feels both too long and rushed. In the beginning I was much more interested about the actual oncoming catastrophe and the prologue characters than the future timeline and the story proper. I also wish more of the world building was being done organically, instead of with encyclopedia-like text dumps. I appreciate trying to integrate it a little by presenting it as in-world newspapers, etc., but it's still a lot of prose and telling, not showing. \n The art is good overall and the style distinctive, but it's a bit too detailed and cluttered sometimes. I also had trouble differentiating characters' faces here and there. \n All that said, I am enjoying Stand Still, Stay Silent. It's excellent stuff when it gets going, and the art is often downright gorgeous.

Il volume comincia con alcune pagine narrative che ci fanno conoscere Katsuya, uno psichiatra. Si accavallano da subito due binari temporali: quello che mostra Katsuya alle prese con un uomo sconosciuto che gli si avvicina in un bar, e quello in cui si trova suo prigioniero. Del sequestratore non e dato conoscere niente - nome, fattezze, legame con Katsuya - tranne la morbosa attrazione nei suoi confronti; ma al termine di questo prologo, Katsuya sembra far mente locale e rammentarsi del loro incontro. A questo punto la narrazione verbale si trasforma in narrazione grafica, e la storia cambia completamente scenario: ci si trova in un periodo in cui Katsuya viene convocato per raccogliere confessioni, pensieri e informazioni da un uomo accusato di una serie di omicidi di cui lui stesso ha stilato il profilo. La relazione fra questi eventi e quelli che aprono il volume resta da scoprire. \n La tecnica narrativa e d'impatto. Il prologo narrato verbalmente intreccia eventi passati e futuri, ponendo il lettore nell'immediata esigenza di coglierne il punto in comune - chi sia e cosa voglia il sequestratore di Katsuya. Tuttavia lascia l'interrogativo sulla sua identita, e quando il protagonista sembra finalmente ricordarsi chi sia, lo scenario cambia. Le tavole grafiche sono stupefacenti: a differenza di molti yaoi, in cui la caratterizzazione dei personaggi e fortemente alterata femminilizzando uno e mantenendo virile l'altro (seme e uke), qui la virilita dei personaggi viene mantenuta. Non esiste alcuna deformazione fisica o caratteriale che deriva dalla situazione di \"passivita\" di un personaggio, cosa che personalmente proprio non mi piace del filone yaoi. In \"In These Words\" decisamente questo stereotipo grafico non esiste: i disegni sono bellissimi, realistici, curati nei dettagli. Ogni tavola merita di essere goduta con calma, esaminata nei particolari - che siano i corpi, i vestiti, gli sguardi dei personaggi. \n Ma non si tratta solo di questione estetica delle tavole. I personaggi sono accattivanti. Nel primo volume sono appena accennati, ma si colgono subito alcuni tratti salienti: Katsuya sembra avere la tipica mentalita medica - razionale, distaccata, pragmatica. Non ama girare attorno alle cose, ma punta al cuore delle situazioni; e schietto, onesto e con un orgoglio fuori dal comune, incapace di piegarsi o sottomettersi, e mantiene la sua emotivita ben celata. Shibata e solo una comparsa, un giovane assistente messo a disposizione di Katsuya per ogni sua necessita, ma mi ha fatto una gran tenerezza nella sua forma di riverenza, rispetto e ammirazione con cui lo accompagna. E il tipico ragazzo inesperto idealista e desideroso di fare la sua parte, anche se piccola. Kizaki, da parte sua, appare realistico e basta qualche pennellata per farne cogliere la personalita forte, esigente e impositiva, perfettamente coerente col suo ruolo di capo della polizia. \n Se apprezzate i disegni di alto livello, i thriller con forti componenti psicologiche e personaggi di spessore, questo romanzo a fumetti fa per voi. E un promettente inizio di una serie che senza dubbio continuero a leggere. \n Attenzione: scene esplicite di violenza e sesso non consenziente fra uomini. Evitate se non apprezzate queste componenti.", "date_added": "Sun Jul 30 09:22:22 -0700 2017", "date_updated": "Sat Aug 05 07:46:24 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

Long before Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning started their excellent run of series and mini series re-establishing it. I have a lot of respect for what they did for Marvel with Nova, Guardians of the Galaxy and everything else that has occurred in the last few years. Sadly with Annihilators, the story takes a great departure from everything that came before it. I'm not speaking in regards to the change in the characters that it featured...Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Ronan, Quasar, Gladiator all on one team is fantastic and the tales that could have come from such a pair, unimaginable...especially since they took the route that the creative team decided to go with. While sparkling with some interesting ideas, the stereotype dialog, uncharacteristic dialog with Silver Surfer, with a cast of all Aliens with exception of Quasar, everything is soaked in human like attributes, emotions, and ideologies. Incredible and great threats were tackled in previous books and done so by far weaker characters while the threat the Annihilators took on was grave, it was handled in a rushed, overview like, manner. Obviously, rushed, as the previous storylines had far greater space to handle the plot than Annihilators did. Tan Eng Huat is a good artist but a better choice could have been made for the overall tone and feel of the story. With approximately 80 pages of a story, it felt like Quasars perspective of a much bigger idea...as if there were more books about the story and this was Quasars chapter. Annihilators also introduces Ikon, a Space Knight with sideways references to Rom and brings back Roms main villain race, the Dire Wraiths, Immortus and his Army of Ages, and Skrulls - all very cool...except they appear in the last handful of pages where a recap of events that leads to their appearance in the story is longer than their actual appearance - as mentioned, rushed. Doctor Dredd, a villain with potential that seems to be a throw away character that is taken out by the amazingly strong tendril of the Wraith Queen that also somehow took down Silver Surfer. Oh, also the Rigellian race appeared at the start...adding a little bit more to their make up, which is cool and realistically, I think most of my critical viewpoint is sadly easily hammered out as: a creative team on a book that has a lot of great ideas, but were not given the room to properly explore them. Not knowing the behind the scenes aspect, it seems that the ideas could have and perhaps were intended to have a lot more room devoted to them, but in the end, did not. \n Meanwhile: \n Now, Rocket Raccoon and Groot also are featured in what was going to be a mini series, and was thrown into the original Annihilators mini series as a back up. Same writers, different artist, this time around. The characters kept in character. More patronage to what happened in the past was made, the story was well paced and had a story and an artist that fit together. This storyline was always intended to be a mini series. And its pacing and plot shows it. \n Thus why I feel the Annihilators storyline was rushed. The creative team on the book are quality professionals. I think the let down in the Annihilators was more on part of the company directive than anything else. \n Lasting comment would be, with its faughts, its still worth adding to ones collection of the Cosmic Marvel. There are plenty of ideas worth revisiting and hopefully will. And if they are, hopefully it won't be so rushed.", "date_added": "Sat Mar 31 06:45:09 -0700 2012", "date_updated": "Mon Jan 06 22:18:00 -0800 2014", "read_at": "", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}
